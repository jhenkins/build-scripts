# Build scripts

These are some rough and ready build scripts I use to build some of my favourite software systems from source.
There is no specific reasons other that "because it's possible" and "therefore I can", so if you find these
scripts useful for the same reasons, please feel free to grab them and use them as you see fit.

The software that is compiled by these scripts will have individual build dependencies. Please ensure you have
read the individual build docs for each, and ensure you have the correct dependencies installed.
