# This is a very "quick-'n-dirty" script in order to build
# Kdenlive. If you want to criticise, feel free to do so.
# If you want to re-write it, by all means!
#
# There are many reasons why you would want to
# or build Kdenlive from source, so instead of debating
# on whether it's a good idea or not, just build it.
# This script is meant for Debian-style environments,
# specifically Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and similar.
# If you want to roll your on for your favourite distribution,
# please read the build documentation. In fact, read it anyway,
# because it will help you understand which dependencies you
# will need to install in order to build Kdenlive.
#
# Docs:
#   https://github.com/KDE/kdenlive/blob/master/dev-docs/build.md
#
# This script is released under the MIT licence (see LICENSE file),
# which means you can do with it what you want. If you break it,
# you even get to keep the pieces, which is nice! :-D
